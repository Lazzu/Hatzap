Hatzap game engine
==================
This is my work in progress game engine in MIT licence. It is not in production-ready state. A large refactoring has been planned some time in future.

History
-------
Project started at Assembly Summer 2014. The name was randomly generated by using tools of the internets. Now at Assembly Summer 2015 I released it publicly in github.
